## TODO

* Upgrade to ExecJS 2.7 â€“ needs to be patched to run async code
* test pre-process sass, scss, css via Sprockets (or .sass.m, .scss.m, .css.m ?)
* add configuration that can be environment specific (format of the generated class name)
* test performance in production (add cache?)

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
